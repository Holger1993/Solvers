# Solvers
Will try to build solvers for a number of different number puzzles, such as sudoku, kakuro and so forth


# Sudoku:
How to use the sudoku solver:

- Add the sudoku as a new .txt file in SudokuSolver/Sudokus
- Change the SudokuSolver/main.py to include the correct .txt file
- Run the main file

TODO:
- Take the .txt file as a command
